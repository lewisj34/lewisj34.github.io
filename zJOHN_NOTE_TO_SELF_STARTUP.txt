TO BUILD THE ENTIRE WEBSITE: NOW THAT WERE DEALING
WITH ACTUALLY UPLOADING THIS STUFF:
from here: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/absolute-url-rendering-links-as-http-localhost/3293
to build the thing you need to run: 

`JEKYLL_ENV="production" bundle exec jekyll build`

which i gguess rewrites some of the html files and stuff and then 

`git add . && git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE" && git push origin master --force`

which will then upload your changes to github and your website will update
